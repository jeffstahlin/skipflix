# Skipflix: Auto Skip Netflix Intro

Bothered by having to click "skip intro" on Netflix?
Skip opening credits automatically using this Chrome Extension.


## Done

- Click the "skip" button automatically
- Swap `setInterval` with MutationObserver API


## To Do

- Option to skip only once (e.g. if you rewind the video, don't skip again)
- Option to skip either recap, intro or both (currently skips both)


## Testing

1\. Open Google Chrome's settings

2\. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the project folder. Click "OK".

<img src="./img/step2.png" width="450" alt="Loading extension" />

3\. Done! The browser has loaded the extension -- the icon is at the top right corner.
