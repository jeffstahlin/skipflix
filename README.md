# Skipflix: Auto Skip Netflix Intro

Bothered by having to click "skip intro" on Netflix?
Skip opening credits automatically using this Chrome Extension.

## Done

- Set an interval to detect the skip button and click it when found.

## To Do

- Replace `setInterval` with an event listener (?) to detect the skip button.
- Option to skip only once (e.g. if you rewind the video, don't skip again).
- Option to skip either:
  - "previously on..."
  - opening credits
  - both (currently works like this)
